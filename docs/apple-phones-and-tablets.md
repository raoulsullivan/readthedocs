# Apple phones and tablets

## What is it: 
Smart phones and tablets designed by Apple are called iPhones and iPads. Unlike Android, where products are made by many different manufacturers, Apple are in charge of designing their own hardware and the software (or operating system) that runs on it, which is known as iOS. They all use touch screen technology to control the device.

All Apple devices have built in accessibility through options like speech feedback, screen magnification, inverted colours, bold text, large cursor and their own built in video magnifier for reading printed materials.

Products range in size from small screen sizes of around 4 inches to large 12.9 inches. The iPhone and iPad can run many similar applications to add functionality.

## Setup:
Any Apple iPhone or iPad needs to be set up with your personal details like Apple ID, wifi network key, pass code, finger print or face ID and any data transferred from an older device.

In addition, Apple devices can be set up independently using accessibility options at start up. In this way you can use the built in tools like VoiceOver (speech) or Zoom (magnification) to set up the device.

A touch screen can seem a little daunting at first, but with practice it is very usable even if you are blind or partially sighted. By touching the screen and using finger gestures such as flicking, tapping, sliding etc. you can control your Apple device.

## Use:
The magnification and speech options on an Apple device give the user access to a huge range of functions on the phone. For example, you can make calls, send texts, email, access web sites and lots more.

In addition, you can download a range of thousands of apps to enhance your Apple device's capabilities. Different apps make it easy to play radio and TV, access music, find out about transport, read documents using the built in camera, identify products and locations, identify bank notes and colours, keep in touch with friends and family, read books, manage your bank accounts and so much more.

## Verdict:
All Apple products are accessible out of the box and don't require the purchase or installation of extra software. You can buy the latest device and have it set up within minutes all without any assistance.

Once you master the concept of the touch screen such a device will fit seamlessly into our lifestyle.

All iOS systems run and act in exactly the same way. This means that you can transfer back and forth between an iPhone or iPad and have a seamless experience with no time taken up by extra training or familiarisation.

Pricing of iPhones can range from £299 to £1150 depending on screen size, storage, functionality and hardware specifications.

iPads come in various forms. Models like the iPad mini, iPad Air 2 and different models of the iPad Pro are available. These different iPads have different hardware specifications, different screen technology, different ways and means of securing the device and audio quality. Pricing of iPads range from £200 to £950 depending on all of the above aspects.
